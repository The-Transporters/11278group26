The project is run on a local server with the use of Node.js

To run the program, Node.js and Node Package Manager must be available on the machine.
	-Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
	-Full tutorial for the two: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows

Once both are properly working and the files from our github are installed, in a terminal you must CD inside of the folder named ‘project’ and run the command ‘npm install’ in order to obtain the necessary node_modules, the team was using the terminals on VS code but anything should work.

Once everything is installed you should be able to run the command ‘npm start’ in the console in order to run the web app. Once running it will open up a localhost page, and the default port is generally: 3000. (http://localhost:3000/). Then the application should display in your browser.
